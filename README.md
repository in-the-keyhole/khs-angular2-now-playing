# angular2-now-playing - Example Angular 2 Application

This repository contains an example Angular 2 application that displays movies currently at the theater. It was built solely as an example of using Angular 2 and is not intended to be used beyond the learning experience. 

The project utilizes the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

While this application is an excellent standalone learning resource, it was also used as a live coding example in the Keyhole Software Breakfast Boost Series "Angular 2 In Action." See below for more information.

### Comparing to React
A similar now-playing app has been developed using React. See what makes this app different by checking it out [here](https://github.com/in-the-keyhole/khs-react-course). 

### Comparing to Angular 1
A similar now-playing app has been developed using Angular 1. See what makes this app different by checking it out [here](https://github.com/in-the-keyhole/angular-now-playing). 

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: You must have Node/npm installed.

1. npm install
2. npm start

This will run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode, and lite-server with Browsersync enabled.  It should automatically launch your default web browser on http://localhost:4200.

### More Information On "Angular 2 In Action!"
In this educational talk, Keyhole Principal Consultants present a live demonstration of Angular 2 in action.

AngularJS is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks available for creating web applications. The switch from Angular 1 and adoption of Angular 2 has been a source of anxiety for members of the enterprise. That enterprise concern is what we seek to alleviate in this talk. 

Throughout the talk, Principal Consultants build an example Angular 2 application applicable to enterprise use. They will point out unique features and approaches the Angular 2 framework introduces, with an eye for potential pitfalls. The presentation will show how it contrasts from Angular 1 and other comparable JavaScript frameworks, in addition to a contrast from existing development patterns and techniques.
